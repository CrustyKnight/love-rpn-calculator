* Reverse Polish Notation Calculator
A small RPN calculator built with love2d and fennel

** TODO: How to use it and stuff

* IDEA: 
Make this have two stacks! then you also have a function to pop a value from
one stack and put on another and vice versa.

Then I will also need a function to switch the stack of focus / the stack the functions apply to.
